# Portofolio
A replication in HTML and CSS of a design mockup.

The web site was constructed using bootstrap, that allowed a grid based layout and full responsiveness. The responsiveness means that the content of the website will be displayed in all screen sizes.

Depending on the screen size, different sizes of images are displayed ensuring good quality with less bandwidth consumption as possible. Grunt was used to generate images with different sizes. 

##To run the website you need to:
- Download the repository.
- Double click the index.html file
